# SecurEd Technical Assessment

Hello

My name is Andy Nguyen and this is my attempt at completing the SecurEd Technical Assessment. I am still very new to web developnent, but I am excited to learn new technologies and be a problem solver!

# About Me
I graduated from Towson University back in spring 2021 with a Applied Mathematics major and I am back again as a first (now second) semester graduate student at Towson University studying Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I was a Securities Analyst after graduation and didn't find the job to be peaking my interests and computer science was something I was curious about during undergraduate, but doubted if I was good enough (good ole imposter syndrome). 

# Interests
Some of my interests are:
+ Playing the piano 
+ Videos games (been meaning to play Lethal Company and Baldurs Gate) 
+ Hiking 
+ Spending time with friends
+ Messing with my girlfriend's rabbit
