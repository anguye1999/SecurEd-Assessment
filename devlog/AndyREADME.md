# My Devlog

# Overview
Hello, my name is Andy Nguyen, and I will be attempting the Technical Assessment for SecurEd’s Junior Software Developer Position. I would consider myself to be a beginner and new to the tech stack with some prior knowledge of HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript. I have not touched Node or Express JS before, but I am excited to learn new technologies and see how they are hand in hand with JavaScript. 

After downloading all the required installations, I went over the frontend and backend tasks of the full stack project to see which I should go for. I decided to go for the backend tasks because after looking through the folder, the heroes module was already created so I thought why not use the module as a reference to create the quest’s module, it wouldn’t be too bad. Also, compared to the frontend task, I would need to understand how Angular 2+ and some Typescript to have a better understanding on how to code so I thought it might take some time so if I have extra time I would attempt the frontend tasks. 

# Day 1: Testing the Hero module
After installing the dependencies and starting the backend development API with npm start which I then learned it means that it execute the start script in the package.json, in our case it is the “node.src/app.js”. I received the message of “Welcome to the Backend API!” when going to the localhost:3000 in my browser. Afterwards, I want to test out the Heroes module using Postman to test the existing routes that was provided to get a better understanding of how the Quests module should work. I was able to create a hero with the POST request and a 201-status code appeared. Then I used the ID that was constructed in the Hero.js to Get the specific hero with that ID. Next, I used the PATCH request to change the hero’s name from “John Doe” to “Jane Doe” and using the hero ID I was able to delete the hero. After testing the hero module, I had a better understanding on how the Quest module should be but using the endpoints that are given on the backend folder.

# Day 2, 3, 4: Getting up to speed 
Since I only have basic understanding of JavaScript, I wanted to learn from the ground up so I can grasp what does Node and Express do and how they are important. I supplemented my learning using YouTube tutorial videos such as SuperSimpleDev’s Introduction to JavaScript, Introduction to Node and Express JS from Dave Gray, and ChatGPT for quick terminology search up to get a better foundation to important topics on tools that are being used. While brushing up on JavaScript, I learned the basics again such as console.log, variables, strings, and then how to initialize functions and the document object model (DOM). I also try to answer any and all exercises that are on the video for practice and retaining the knowledge. Then I went into Dave Gray’s introduction to Node JS which helped me understand that instead of working on the browser like vanilla JS, Node executes JavaScript code outside the browser and in this case, it would be the terminal. I went over surface level information about reading/writing file and node package manager to understand what npm is and do. Next was Introduction to Express JS where it went into creating routes/routers, testing the routes in the browser, and building a simple CRUD app which is very similar to the Hero/Quest assignment.


# Day 5, 6, and 7: Starting the tasks
First, I created the QuestsDB.js that would store an array of quests and returns either the array or specific id of the quest using from the HeroesDB.js file. 

Next, was to see how the Heroes.spec.js was coded and copied over which ode I can use in the “Quests.spec.js” file. This is where I would need to create the endpoints that would respond to the each of the https methods and send the status code for each case in which the quest was found (200), created (201) or not (404). The problem I came into was the 400-status code, the route of the heroID does not match with the questID in the database. I was struggling to figure out what I should do here, I had to reference many YouTube videos on express and ChatGPT to understand the logic on that 400 Bad Request code. However, I eventually created another quest ID labeled as q2_ID and a different hero ID that associates with that quest called h2_ID. With this we can check the endpoint and logic, if the hero ID does not equal with other quest’s hero ID then we would invoke a 400 error status, else we can send a status 204. 

# Day 8 and onwards: Takeaways and using Git
Unfortunately, due to projects and finals coming up. It became hard to balance time for the assessment so there are some more issues and possible changes I came across while finishing up the tasks. One was learning Git because I only used it once or twice before for projects and I realized I didn’t properly stage my changes and use different branches other than the main branch to show my commits. Therefore, I only have some of my changes listed on my GitHub so for next time I want to be more on top of documenting my flow better which is vital when working in a team environment. Next are some changes I could’ve done to make the code look nicer. I noticed in the Quests router.js file, I could’ve created a function to create the hero/heroID and quest/questID rather than constructing for every router endpoints to reduce redundancy.
